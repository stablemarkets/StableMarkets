My name is Arman Oganisian, currently a 5th year Biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. My research is focused on development nonparametric Bayesian methods with an emphasis on causal inference problems. I am also on the Stan Project's Governing Body for the 2021 term. 

Here you will find repos containing software supporting published/working papers, software packages, and tutorial codes. See my web site for more on my research.
